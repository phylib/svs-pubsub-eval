# Clients for SVS Pub-Sub evaluation

## Install

First install SVS as the dependency

```bash
git clone https://github.com/named-data/ndn-svs.git ndn-svs
cd ndn-svs
git checkout develop
git apply ../path-to/svs-patch.patch
./waf
sudo ./waf install
```

To install Catch2:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
cd Catch2
git checkout v2.13.6
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j && sudo make install
sudo ldconfig 
```

Then compile executables using CMake

```bash
cmake .
make
```

## Run

Register multicast prefix:

```bash
nfdc strategy set /ndn/svs /localhost/nfd/strategy/multicast
```

Start NFD and then start the clients

```bash
nfdc cs erase /
./SVSClient /platoon1/unit3
./SVSClient /platoon2/unit4
```

Every client listens to:
- `/ndn/svs`.. sync group prefix
- `/<prefix>/ndn/svs/`.. prefix for SVS Data packets named with seq-no
- `/<prefix>/ndn/svs/mapping`.. prefix for retrieving mapping data
- `/position`.. Data prefix of Position data packets
- `/voice`.. Data prefix of voice data packets

Voice and Position data packets are served under the following names:
-  `/voice/<prefix>/<timestamp>/v=0/s=<segement>`.. First segment is synced over SVS Pub/Sub, other segments retrieved using interest-data exchange
-  `/position/<prefix>/<timestamp>`.. should not be required, since synced over SVS Pub/Sub
